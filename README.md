# MoreDerivatives
This LaTeX package provides you with more options for derivatives. Not only does it include the regular and partial derivatives, but also more unorthodox ones, such as the rotated-varrho derivative.

The goal of the package is to provide the user with macros for variations on derivatives when needed. For example, in a vector bundle, the action of a connection $\nabla$ on some section $s$ along a path $\gamma(t)$ behaves like a derivative to $t$, and could be denoted $\frac{\nabla(s\circ\gamma)}{\mathrm{d}t}$.
